LogoBatch
*********

``LogoBatch`` is a simple utility for distributing shell commands on a beowulf
cluster using ``Slurm`` or ``SSH``. LogoBatch was originally designed to 
automate the process of running thousands of NetLogo models. 

**LogoBatch is pre-release software.**
LogoBatch is currently being refactored.

Batch Of Batches (BBatch)
-------------------------
As the name suggests, a BBatch is a set of batches defined in a YAML file
to be passed to LogoBatch, which distributes them over your defined 
computing resources.

Batch Image
-----------

Batch Images are packages to be used to save and distribute batches. Batch
Images can be created with using LogoBatch's utility ``makebimg``.

Batch Image structure
=====================

Some structural elements were taken from 
`cookie-cutter-data-science <https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science>`_.
